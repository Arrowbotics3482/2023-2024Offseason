Problem 1:
Make a CANSparkmax object and make the motor turn when a button on the controller is pressed and make it turn off when the button is released. Please use commands to do so.

Problem 2:
Use PIDcontrollers and the encoder value from the built in encoder from the CANSparkmaxs. When the driver presses one button the motor should spin to a choosen setpoint, and then when another button is pressed the motor should spin to a setpoint of 0.
